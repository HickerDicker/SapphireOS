  msys2 v20200903
  gcc v7.3.0

Version 1.8.0.722
14 November 2020
* Driver Packs 20.11.1
* The script "select" command will now AND the first set of options with the
  driver pack filters. For example, previously the command "select better lan"
  would select "all better drivers" as well as "all lan drivers".  This will now select
  "all better lan drivers". In other words both conditions must be true rather
  than either condition. The command "select missing better lan wlan-wifi" will
  select missing or better drivers that exist in the lan or wlan-wifi driver packs.
* Tools updated as follows:
  msys2 v20200903
  gcc v7.3.0
  boost v1.64.0
  webp v0.6.1

  7-Zip v16.04

Version 1.7.1.721

* Further testing revealed some issues with the new code that deals with path
  read/write conditions and building directory structures.
* Tools updated as follows:
  msys2 v20200903
  gcc v7.1.0
  boost v1.63.0
  webp v0.6.1
  libtorrent v1.0.8
  7-Zip v16.02

Version 1.7.0.720
26 October 2020
* Driver Packs 20.10.3
* Fixed bug in script mode when there are spaces in the paths.
* Added functions to better test for write/read-only conditions both locally 
  and when running over a network share using UNC paths. SDIO now better
  operates in a read-only environment.
* I've added a discussion to the Reference Manual on how to run SDIO over a
  network share.
* Added a test in the install procedure to check availability of the next
  driver pack before attempting to open it. If the driver pack is not 
  available, SDIO will pause for 5 seconds and try again. It will do this up
  to 20 times before failing. This helps overcome the problem of devices being
  temporarily unavailable due to a previous driver install.
* Translations.
* Tools updated as follows:
  msys2 v20200903
  gcc v7.1.0
  boost v1.63.0

  getting mangled.
* Script: Fixed bug with network paths and paths with spaces.
* Script: Fixed bug where the select command was failing.

  See the remote.bat in scripts for an example.

Version 1.6.4.714
7 June 2020
* Driver Packs 20.05.5
* If TEMP environment variable is not set then use the system drive.
* Fixed bug in script where the select command is not working.
* Verify driver pack has downloaded and is available before extraction. If
  you get an Error 2 during driver installation, check the console output
  to see if the driver pack file is missing. It may be due to out of date
  indexes or the torrent download failed for some reason.
* Translations.

21 February 2020

* Now driver updates works correctly when the dpr_dir is on a different drive. It 
  can be a different drive on the same computer, a network path or mapped drive. 
* If SDIO detects this path is not the working path, it will perform a copy/delete 
  instead of a move operation in order to move downloaded driver packs to the 
  drivers directory.
* Fixed cli help display formatting.
* Fixed bug with coax theme.

  found and no command line arguments given (ie new users).
* Updated torrent agent id.
* Moved some themes out to Additional Themes.

* Added seeding option to Updates dialog. This keeps the update session running,
  seeding all files that have been downloaded. When the update session is stopped
  by clicking on the update button, the updates are processed in the normal
  fashion. This is perfect if you leave updates running overnight.
* Added 'Seed driver packs' option to the System Menu. At any time when not doing
  updates, you can switch this on to enable sharing of the driver packs in your
  working "drivers" directory. Sometimes it wants to do a little downloading
  first, this is a quirk in the bittorrent protocol and is normal and
  unavoidable. This is different to the seeding option on the Updates dialog.
* Added more status feedback from the torrent.
* Added 'Checking for updates' status on startup.

* A bunch of small changes and fixes.
